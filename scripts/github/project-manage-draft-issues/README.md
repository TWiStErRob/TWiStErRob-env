# GitHub draft issue creator for Projects

Helper script for bulk-creating/updating draft issues. It supports setting custom fields, but it needs some coding to make it do what you want, because the GitHub API for Projects is GraphQL only, so it's pretty low level.

## Development

This is a Kotlin Script. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](../../../.github/DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information.
