But this talk might not be for you then.\r\n\r\nWhile Compose-only is a dream experience, the reality is that existing apps will be mixed Views and Compose for a long time. The most common migration strategy is: all new features written in Compose, while old code remains in Views. \r\n\r\nDevs do refactor old code as well - but it’s not a must. You don’t need a Compose-only app to reap the benefits of Compose. So, let’s embark on a journey of partially migrating a View sample, to test a few hypotheses:\r\n\r\n- “Migration of common UI first” strategy\r\n- View and Compose interop capabilities\r\n- Migrating to Compose while keeping original navigation\r\n- Redesigning a feature/screen? Perfect time to migrate!\r\n- Migrating to Compose? Perfect time to add large screen support!\r\n- Views to Compose don’t always need a 1:1 mapping",

However, until recently, there was no easy way to use Compose to create IDE plugins without too many compromises. Jewel is a new library that solves this problem by providing a set of tools and components that make it easy to create Compose for Desktop-based plugins for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce Jewel and show you how to use it to create your own IDE plugins. The session will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n* Why Compose makes a huge difference in IDE plugin development\r\n* How to set up Compose in your IDE plugin project\r\n* What's Jewel, a library implementing the IntelliJ themes and a composables\r\n* What are the tradeoffs in using Compose and Jewel\r\n* Case studies of existing implementations\r\n* What's the future for Jewel and Compose as a plugin UI framework\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Android developers who are familiar with Compose but have never created an IDE plugin because they don't wanna learn Swing. By the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding of how to use Jewel to create your own Compose-based IDE plugins.",

Writing multiplatform code with it doesn't diverge much from our usual routine, and now with Compose Multiplaform, we can write an entire iOS app without knowing a thing about iOS development. But to truly conquer the world of mobile development, we need to bring the iOS developers to our side. Join us in this exciting presentation where we unravel the secrets of crafting Kotlin Multiplatform libraries that your iOS teammates won’t believe they weren’t written in Swift. Discover how Kotlin constructs are translated into Objective-C/Swift and explore effective strategies for addressing any translation problems. Learn tricks that ensure iOS developers will enjoy a frictionless experience while consuming KMM APIs. By using KMM one can significantly reduce development time and bug count.",

And how much time do you spend fixing them when refactoring?\r\n\r\nA few short years ago, we would test a class in JUnit by stacking one test after the other, mocking each one of its dependencies. But for large apps, writing tests in this way without any consideration of architecture can easily become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nFor a task that takes so much of our time every day as developers, there is surprisingly little discussion online about optimal test design. At Perry Street Software, publisher of two of the world's most popular LGBTQ+ dating apps, after struggling writing and maintaining our unit tests in the past, we have spent much time developing what we like to call the Unit Testing Diet.\r\n\r\nOur Unit Testing Diet provides a healthy way to test and refactor an app at scale, by testing the behavior that a user performs and the outcome that they will perceive, without testing implementation details.\r\n\r\nJoin this talk to learn how to:\r\n\r\n1. Test your ViewModels, UseCases, and Repositories in a Given-When-Then style, without using mocks\r\n2. Test the behavior and not the implementation details\r\n3.

            "description": "In early times of Android development we used to have big activities. All view and business logic were being written in activities. Then fragments were introduced so that activities started to become leaner. Then several architectural patterns have started to appear in the Android scene: MVP, MVVM, MVI, etc. While all these were happening, ViewModel like classes started to get bigger and bigger. They have become the new big activities. However, we haven't often considered splitting view models into manageable self-contained granular ones.\r\n\r\nViews are composable and they can be composed to build bigger views. What about introducing smaller ViewModels, namely UI models, and using them to build composable UI models/View Models?  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce the micro-feature architecture that leverages granular UI models. We'll demonstrate how this approach enables us to create leaner UI hosts by breaking down view models into smaller, self-contained logical UI models. Moreover, we'll explore the distinctions between a UI model and a Jetpack ViewModel. \r\n\r\nWe'll delve into the advantages offered by micro-feature architecture, particularly in terms of single responsibility, composability, reusability, and testability. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how adopting this architecture can significantly enhance your development process and empower you to build high-quality, scalable applications which has highly dynamic contextual screens. \r\n\r\nMicro-feature architecture is used in several screens of 2 big apps in production which are now being used by 10M+ users. We will be also sharing our learnings about using this approach in these apps. ",

Doing Open Source is a fine art which requires skill you don’t easily learn on schoolbooks. Creating a new library is like building a new house that people want to live in: you need to start with a great foundation, build your inner walls and then add all the niceties that make your house the best place to live in. \r\n\r\nJoin us as we share our journey building Open Source Android libraries: we’ll start from tools to help you organize your code, we’ll learn how to publish your libraries publicly and how to effectively maintain them. Throughout this journey, we’ll share our experience maintaining popular Android libraries such as Detekt, Chucker and AppIntro.\r\n\r\nA house won’t be a home without someone living inside it, though. As your library won’t be a popular library without a strong community around it. So we’ll have the opportunity to share our insights on building strong communities around Open Source, getting developers together, finding new contributors and dealing with maintainer burnout.\r\n\r\nCurious to know how to build a shiny new library brick by brick? Then make sure to don’t miss out this talk, and we can’t wait to see what you all will be building!",

We will cover build cache misses and configuration cache issues as well as how to debug and solve them with various tools such as with the free Build Scan service, Android Studio debugger and also with Develocity.\r\n\r\nWe will then demonstrate combining the powerful Build Validation Scripts with automation and notifications to systematically surface new build cache misses and to keep them from reappearing once they have been fixed.\r\n\r\nWe will close by diving into the just released Artifact Transform insights in the free Build Scan tool. This is one of the most commonly requested features by Android developers. We will also close off by showing how you can use the new Tests API in Develocity to automate your flaky test workflows.",

It has taken me more than 20 years of interviews, both as a candidate and as an interviewer, to come up with a process and key aspects that I try hard to go through before hosting an interview. \r\nI've also learned as a candidate signs of an unhealthy company and a few take aways that I can apply to when I'm interviewing myself. Both positive and negative.\r\nIn this session I will share my history of technical interviews, what I look for when interviewing, how I want to set the scene, and how I try to always get the best out of each interview. Hopefully you can take away some learnings and inspiration for your own interviews after hearing me out. ",

With the arrival of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the massive amount of GitHub data Microsoft has used to train it, it's evident that OpenAI's large language models will also transform the software development process. In this discussion, Sofy CEO and founder Syed Hamid will share a variety of use cases that provide insight into how this technology is changing today's software testing landscape. Syed will also discuss how Sofy has harnessed the power of GPTs to further amplify Sofy's revolutionary no-code mobile app testing approach.",

We will cover topics such as collaboration within your team, available tools and when it makes sense to use them, and modifications to your project to ensure adding accessibility is a pain-free experience for feature development and testing. By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive product and provide a better user experience for all.",

            "description": "Dart 3 is packed with new experimental language features, including Records, Pattern Matching, Algebraic datatypes, and Destructuring. Like Extensions, they’ll open up new opportunities for packages and ways to express oneself in code. Through concrete examples, Pascal will guide you through the syntax of these new features and demonstrate how they can be used to create more expressive and maintainable code.\r\n\r\nYou’ll learn about:\r\n\r\n- The benefits of the new Dart 3 language features\r\n- The considerations in designing these features\r\n- What the syntax looks like in isolation\r\n- New patterns and anti-patterns and how they will shape our Dart code of tomorrow\r\n\r\nWhether you're a seasoned Dart developer or just getting started, this talk will help you get up to speed on the latest advancements in the language. Don't wait for the future to arrive – start exploring these new features today and take your code to the next level.",

Writing multiplatform code with it doesn't diverge much from our usual routine, and now with Compose Multiplaform, we can write an entire iOS app without knowing a thing about iOS development. But to truly conquer the world of mobile development, we need to bring the iOS developers to our side. Join us in this exciting presentation where we unravel the secrets of crafting Kotlin Multiplatform libraries that your iOS teammates won’t believe they weren’t written in Swift. Discover how Kotlin constructs are translated into Objective-C/Swift and explore effective strategies for addressing any translation problems. Learn tricks that ensure iOS developers will enjoy a frictionless experience while consuming KMM APIs. By using KMM one can significantly reduce development time and bug count.",

              "description": "So you have an idea, and you want to publish a library for it? But where do you start? Doing Open Source is a fine art which requires skill you don’t easily learn on schoolbooks. Creating a new library is like building a new house that people want to live in: you need to start with a great foundation, build your inner walls and then add all the niceties that make your house the best place to live in. \r\n\r\nJoin us as we share our journey building Open Source Android libraries: we’ll start from tools to help you organize your code, we’ll learn how to publish your libraries publicly and how to effectively maintain them. Throughout this journey, we’ll share our experience maintaining popular Android libraries such as Detekt, Chucker and AppIntro.\r\n\r\nA house won’t be a home without someone living inside it, though. As your library won’t be a popular library without a strong community around it. So we’ll have the opportunity to share our insights on building strong communities around Open Source, getting developers together, finding new contributors and dealing with maintainer burnout.\r\n\r\nCurious to know how to build a shiny new library brick by brick? Then make sure to don’t miss out this talk, and we can’t wait to see what you all will be building!",

But this talk might not be for you then.\r\n\r\nWhile Compose-only is a dream experience, the reality is that existing apps will be mixed Views and Compose for a long time. The most common migration strategy is: all new features written in Compose, while old code remains in Views. \r\n\r\nDevs do refactor old code as well - but it’s not a must. You don’t need a Compose-only app to reap the benefits of Compose. So, let’s embark on a journey of partially migrating a View sample, to test a few hypotheses:\r\n\r\n- “Migration of common UI first” strategy\r\n- View and Compose interop capabilities\r\n- Migrating to Compose while keeping original navigation\r\n- Redesigning a feature/screen? Perfect time to migrate!\r\n- Migrating to Compose? Perfect time to add large screen support!\r\n- Views to Compose don’t always need a 1:1 mapping",

However, accessibility is often treated as an afterthought in the development process, which can lead to exclusion and frustration for users with disabilities. This talk aims to change that by discussing how to make accessibility a core part of your development workflow. We will cover topics such as collaboration within your team, available tools and when it makes sense to use them, and modifications to your project to ensure adding accessibility is a pain-free experience for feature development and testing. By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive product and provide a better user experience for all.",

              "description": "In early times of Android development we used to have big activities. All view and business logic were being written in activities. Then fragments were introduced so that activities started to become leaner. Then several architectural patterns have started to appear in the Android scene: MVP, MVVM, MVI, etc. While all these were happening, ViewModel like classes started to get bigger and bigger. They have become the new big activities. However, we haven't often considered splitting view models into manageable self-contained granular ones.\r\n\r\nViews are composable and they can be composed to build bigger views. What about introducing smaller ViewModels, namely UI models, and using them to build composable UI models/View Models?  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce the micro-feature architecture that leverages granular UI models. We'll demonstrate how this approach enables us to create leaner UI hosts by breaking down view models into smaller, self-contained logical UI models. Moreover, we'll explore the distinctions between a UI model and a Jetpack ViewModel. \r\n\r\nWe'll delve into the advantages offered by micro-feature architecture, particularly in terms of single responsibility, composability, reusability, and testability. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how adopting this architecture can significantly enhance your development process and empower you to build high-quality, scalable applications which has highly dynamic contextual screens. \r\n\r\nMicro-feature architecture is used in several screens of 2 big apps in production which are now being used by 10M+ users. We will be also sharing our learnings about using this approach in these apps. ",

              "description": "Jetpack Compose is the declarative UI toolkit for Android that makes it easy to create beautiful, responsive apps. However, until recently, there was no easy way to use Compose to create IDE plugins without too many compromises. Jewel is a new library that solves this problem by providing a set of tools and components that make it easy to create Compose for Desktop-based plugins for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will introduce Jewel and show you how to use it to create your own IDE plugins. The session will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n* Why Compose makes a huge difference in IDE plugin development\r\n* How to set up Compose in your IDE plugin project\r\n* What's Jewel, a library implementing the IntelliJ themes and a composables\r\n* What are the tradeoffs in using Compose and Jewel\r\n* Case studies of existing implementations\r\n* What's the future for Jewel and Compose as a plugin UI framework\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended for Android developers who are familiar with Compose but have never created an IDE plugin because they don't wanna learn Swing. By the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding of how to use Jewel to create your own Compose-based IDE plugins.",

It has taken me more than 20 years of interviews, both as a candidate and as an interviewer, to come up with a process and key aspects that I try hard to go through before hosting an interview. \r\nI've also learned as a candidate signs of an unhealthy company and a few take aways that I can apply to when I'm interviewing myself. Both positive and negative.\r\nIn this session I will share my history of technical interviews, what I look for when interviewing, how I want to set the scene, and how I try to always get the best out of each interview. Hopefully you can take away some learnings and inspiration for your own interviews after hearing me out. ",

Whereas apps may have the flexibility to add external dependencies and laser-focus on specific use-cases, designing an API requires minimal dependencies and wide applicability. This lightning talk is a crash course in Kotlin error propagation strategies and a case study in our experience designing errors when migrating our SDK from Java to Kotlin. We will go over the various techniques that Kotlin natively provides for us, including throwing exceptions, returning null, sealed classes, and Result, and how we decided which technique to use for our functions.",

You’ll leave this talk with an understanding of how we can improve Android app modularisation to increase developer productivity, organize a clear project structure, access modules faster and assign ownership for better workflows.

With the arrival of Microsoft 365 Copilot and the massive amount of GitHub data Microsoft has used to train it, it's evident that OpenAI's large language models will also transform the software development process. In this discussion, Sofy CEO and founder Syed Hamid will share a variety of use cases that provide insight into how this technology is changing today's software testing landscape. Syed will also discuss how Sofy has harnessed the power of GPTs to further amplify Sofy's revolutionary no-code mobile app testing approach.",

              "description": "How do you write tests? How much time do you spend writing tests? And how much time do you spend fixing them when refactoring?\r\n\r\nA few short years ago, we would test a class in JUnit by stacking one test after the other, mocking each one of its dependencies. But for large apps, writing tests in this way without any consideration of architecture can easily become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nFor a task that takes so much of our time every day as developers, there is surprisingly little discussion online about optimal test design. At Perry Street Software, publisher of two of the world's most popular LGBTQ+ dating apps, after struggling writing and maintaining our unit tests in the past, we have spent much time developing what we like to call the Unit Testing Diet.\r\n\r\nOur Unit Testing Diet provides a healthy way to test and refactor an app at scale, by testing the behavior that a user performs and the outcome that they will perceive, without testing implementation details.\r\n\r\nJoin this talk to learn how to:\r\n\r\n1. Test your ViewModels, UseCases, and Repositories in a Given-When-Then style, without using mocks\r\n2. Test the behavior and not the implementation details\r\n3. Refactor your code without breaking your tests",

For example by using Custom Action or Long Click to reduce the number of Talkback gestures needed to go through one screen. We will also open doors to new gestures to improve the UX of infinite horizontal lists like in Spotify or Netflix, that can be a trap for screen readers. \r\n\r\nPrepare yourself to learn new tricks that will make the usability of your app better for user with a screen reader than for sighted users.\r\n\r\nBonus 🎁 : The highest score to the quiz in the audience will win a small prize.",

This usually happens on larger screens, but why?\r\n\r\nThis is called letterboxing, which is an Android app compatibility mode the platform places an app in if it cannot support a certain window size. In this talk, we will explore why letterboxing happens and how to optimize your app to avoid it. We will also discuss how to ensure that your app looks good on all screens, regardless of the screen orientation or aspect ratio.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, you will be able to:\r\n- Identify the causes of apps running in letterbox mode.\r\n- Understand how to fix this issue.\r\n- Ensure that your app looks good on all devices.",

            "description": "Graphs are a great way to visualize different types of data. But not everyone can consume them the same way - and if you add, e.g., touch interactions, not everyone can use the pointer the same way. Also, not everyone understands graphs the same way - due to prior familiarity, disability, or other reasons. And what if you can't see at all? That is another factor that adds complexity to data visualizations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share some tips and demonstrate how you can improve the accessibility of your graphs so that they work for different types of users - whether they are using assistive technologies or not. You'll get actionable advice to take to your apps and improve their accessibility immediately. You will learn about adding text alternatives for data visualization, adding alternatives for touch, and assuring that color is not the only way to communicate information.",

Is it fast and reliable enough that the team benefits from it?\r\n* Do you need a merge queue or do you need better checks?\r\n* What is consistently missed that you can automate?\r\n* What tedious repetitive tasks can you transform into a welcome resource?\r\n* Are you hitting resource limits that require an engineering investment to mitigate?\r\n* Do you invest in Gradle or Bazel?

How far should you go in your optimizations?\r\n* How do you secure the pipeline?\r\n \r\nWe'll delve into each topic and share how to apply our learnings to empower you.

We'll then dive into Components and Subcomponents to see how Dagger wires together our dependencies into a graph. Finally, we'll look at how Dagger can be extended using Anvil and other tools.",

We have all probably been in the situation of having our apps unexpectedly crashing - either because of a bad release, because of unexpected Backend changes, etc.\r\n\r\nIn these scenarios, we usually get overwhelmed by messages from different departments (support folks, managers, and so on), this is especially true when operating at a large scale, and things can quickly get out of control.\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to propose rules that will not only mitigate the above scenarios but also improve the communication flow, give tips about how to set up alerting systems and what to measure, and talk about a \"post-mortem\" process.",

We’ll go way beyond using `imageViewload(“https://cutecatsimage”)`, and dive deep into Coil’s source code to understand how it handles loading your image into memory, caching, and transforming your image. You’ll walk away from this talk with a rich understanding of the journey the images you’re working with take to show up on your screen, and a being in a much better spot to work with problems that could arise.",

We call this the \"application sandbox\": a safe area for your code to run which prevents other apps from interfering with your data, and prevents you from interfering with other apps or the operating system\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will be looking at the rationale behind the sandbox, and how it works. I will look at file ownership, file access modes and the reasons for those \"Permission denied\" messages. I will dig down to find out exactly why an app can access only a well defined set of private files and shared storage. And I will explain\r\nhow SE Linux enforces all of this at at a deep level\r\n\r\nYou will be reassured that Android is a secure operating system. But, as you know there are always exceptions to the rules. So, in the final section of this talk I will show you how preinstalled system apps can crash though all the barriers\r\n",

But going from idea to shipping something on the Play Store isn’t that easy. How do you organize work? What are the roles and tools to use? And most importantly, how to build a framework onto which you can iterate on multiple ideas, fast?\r\n\r\nThat’s what we had to figure out over the past six months as we launched multiple ideas into production. Join us in a retrospective of how we got from that famous beer to today. We’ll cover how an Android dev such as yourself can organize work to prioritize fast iteration, pick the right tools and technologies, automate the heck out of everything, figure out how to promote and grow the app, plan a business strategy, and understand if it is sustainable.\r\n\r\nBy attending this session, you’ll find out what worked out for us and what didn’t in this process, and how to avoid some mistakes we made. If you’ve ever had the itch to publish an app — by yourself or with some friends — come along to find out what’s ahead of you!",

The world is not short of challenges right now, especially climate change, but we will only have a real impact on the world if we can help people unite and organise to pressure those with power and influence.\r\n\r\nChris and his husband quickly developed an app ten years ago to allow ordinary people to lobby the normally inaccessible and unelected House of Lords to pass the Same Sex Marriage Bill. It unexpectedly took off, with 15,000 emails sent in the space of two weeks, helping the Bill overwhelmingly succeed in the normally-socially-conservative upper House of Parliament in the UK.\r\n\r\nHe'll talk here about how he did it, and how you - an individual with a computer and knowledge of how to knock an app together - can use this skill to give a voice to the voiceless, and to potentially change or even save the world.",

Building with confidence requires an appropriate test harness and automated safeguards to ensure your software is robust.\r\n\r\nIn most real world scenarios, we don't have the luxury of working with a green field project, so it can be difficult to apply best practices whilst maintaining legacy code. How then can we refactor, and effectively utilise test fakes appropriately?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss the best approaches for using test fakes, mocks, stubs, and what are the pros and cons for each. How we can avoid writing brittle tests, slowing down development, and build scalable apps that can stand the test of time.",

But have you ever thought about how you could seamlessly adapt your existing solutions to play nice with other engines like Unity? Or perhaps you’re considering creating an entirely new library to incorporate functionalities that aren't readily available in the core Unity. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Unity paves the way for hybrid Android development, allowing you to embed Unity-created elements, mini-games and augmented reality directly into your Android apps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we're delving into the Unity landscape from an Android developer's perspective. We'll unravel the intricate interplay between Unity scripts and Android code, gaining insights into how IL2CPP and Mono scripting backends operate to seamlessly unite C# and Kotlin.\r\n",

In a Flutter project developed by LeanCode for a client from the banking sector, we decided to experiment with golden tests from the very beginning, and they turned out to be extremely effective. \r\n\r\nDuring the talk, we’ll see what are some good practices and antipatterns for golden tests, what role they can play in the code review process, and take a broader perspective on who can be involved in golden tests (not only developers!). We’ll also consider using golden tests in more advanced testing scenarios for things like responsiveness, accessibility, localization, and others.",

            "description": "Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative centered around Postgres database, one of the world’s most popular databases known for its extensibility, performance, and data integrity. You can create a fresh Supabase project with just a few clicks, and you will gain access to a fully managed Postgres database with serverless APIs, real-time database subscription, auth, file storage, and edge functions. With its Flutter SDK, developers can access the Supabase database securely and efficiently, helping them build complex apps in a matter of days. \r\n\r\nIn this session, I will give you an overview of what Supabase is, and how it is helping developers build scalable applications efficiently. We will also look at a few examples where advanced data types of Postgres, such as geo data, or range data, can help you build complex Flutter applications efficiently. \r\n",

              "description": "The Compose team focused on performance extensively over the last few years. Many of the findings are documented and shared in different forms, but optimization continues to be one of the arcane arts of Compose. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Andrei shares his own experience on optimizing Lazy layouts, focusing on the most notable tips that might help your application performance. He will provide a detailed description of Compose performance characteristics, summarizing a year long team effort to improve (re-)composition performance. Aside from the theory, you’ll also get practical tips about improving your composables derived from the experience of the Compose team.",

They are a powerful tool to protect from visual regressions and improve the quality of your apps. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll go beyond simple examples and take a look at how we can make golden tests part of a development workflow in a bigger Flutter project. In a Flutter project developed by LeanCode for a client from the banking sector, we decided to experiment with golden tests from the very beginning, and they turned out to be extremely effective. \r\n\r\nDuring the talk, we’ll see what are some good practices and antipatterns for golden tests, what role they can play in the code review process, and take a broader perspective on who can be involved in golden tests (not only developers!). We’ll also consider using golden tests in more advanced testing scenarios for things like responsiveness, accessibility, localization, and others.",

Or maybe you want to keep your users engaged by adding delightful little treats in your app... There are a few key principles that unlock a wide range of different animations, from basic to advanced.\r\n\r\nWe will go through some practical examples of how to implement animations in Jetpack Compose, such as working with gestures to control animations and how to do state based animations. Join us to learn how to think about implementing any animation in a step-by-step way. ",

In reality, Dagger generates pretty straight-forward, elegant wiring code similar to how we would likely write it manually and, I believe, it's the complexity of large scale apps that makes it complex.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll look at different types of injection that Dagger supports, and the code it generates to do so, to get an understanding of what it's doing and how it works. We'll then dive into Components and Subcomponents to see how Dagger wires together our dependencies into a graph. Finally, we'll look at how Dagger can be extended using Anvil and other tools.",

The world is not short of challenges right now, especially climate change, but we will only have a real impact on the world if we can help people unite and organise to pressure those with power and influence.\r\n\r\nChris and his husband quickly developed an app ten years ago to allow ordinary people to lobby the normally inaccessible and unelected House of Lords to pass the Same Sex Marriage Bill. It unexpectedly took off, with 15,000 emails sent in the space of two weeks, helping the Bill overwhelmingly succeed in the normally-socially-conservative upper House of Parliament in the UK.\r\n\r\nHe'll talk here about how he did it, and how you - an individual with a computer and knowledge of how to knock an app together - can use this skill to give a voice to the voiceless, and to potentially change or even save the world.",

Users are no longer forgiving mobile app mishaps and errors. Going beyond the basic metrics of understanding your user experience and diving deep into mobile performance is key to ensuring growth and positive user experiences. We will highlight which metrics and takeaways mobile teams should track to create a superior app experience that takes into account every user interaction. Find out why app insights, proactive issue detection, advanced debugging, and alert management capabilities should matter to you and the development of your mobile app.",

Building with confidence requires an appropriate test harness and automated safeguards to ensure your software is robust.\r\n\r\nIn most real world scenarios, we don't have the luxury of working with a green field project, so it can be difficult to apply best practices whilst maintaining legacy code. How then can we refactor, and effectively utilise test fakes appropriately?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll discuss the best approaches for using test fakes, mocks, stubs, and what are the pros and cons for each. How we can avoid writing brittle tests, slowing down development, and build scalable apps that can stand the test of time.",

We’ll go way beyond using `imageViewload(“https://cutecatsimage”)`, and dive deep into Coil’s source code to understand how it handles loading your image into memory, caching, and transforming your image. You’ll walk away from this talk with a rich understanding of the journey the images you’re working with take to show up on your screen, and a being in a much better spot to work with problems that could arise.",

We call this the \"application sandbox\": a safe area for your code to run which prevents other apps from interfering with your data, and prevents you from interfering with other apps or the operating system\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will be looking at the rationale behind the sandbox, and how it works. I will look at file ownership, file access modes and the reasons for those \"Permission denied\" messages. I will dig down to find out exactly why an app can access only a well defined set of private files and shared storage. And I will explain\r\nhow SE Linux enforces all of this at at a deep level\r\n\r\nYou will be reassured that Android is a secure operating system. But, as you know there are always exceptions to the rules. So, in the final section of this talk I will show you how preinstalled system apps can crash though all the barriers\r\n",

But not everyone can consume them the same way - and if you add, e.g., touch interactions, not everyone can use the pointer the same way. Also, not everyone understands graphs the same way - due to prior familiarity, disability, or other reasons. And what if you can't see at all? That is another factor that adds complexity to data visualizations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share some tips and demonstrate how you can improve the accessibility of your graphs so that they work for different types of users - whether they are using assistive technologies or not. You'll get actionable advice to take to your apps and improve their accessibility immediately. You will learn about adding text alternatives for data visualization, adding alternatives for touch, and assuring that color is not the only way to communicate information.",

I want to help people not feel the way I felt.\r\nBeing at a conference seeing all the latest and greatest things can reinforce those feelings, so I will help bring everything back into perspective.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I will outline a series of strategies you can follow, from day to day activities to thinking in the years of your career, and a specific set of recommendations for our current state in 2023.",

But not anymore! Let me introduce ZeKompanion: A multiplatform app that communicates with ZeBadge, no matter the platform (except for iOS).\r\n\r\nThis talk will guide through the architecture of the app, describing the abstractions taken and explain how you can leverage Kotlin Multiplatform for Mobile to abstract the platform specific USB communication from the Compose UI displayed on all devices.\r\n\r\nFollow here for an interesting journey about USB Serial communication, Kotlin and KMM, Jetpack Compose and how to boil it all together into one app: ZeKompanion.\r\n",

In this talk we will break down: \r\n- What is background work vs foreground service vs asynchronous work?\r\n- What’s new with Foreground Services in Android 14?\r\n- We'll provide a framework to help you decide what API to use in Android 14\r\n- We'll go over some common misconceptions around WorkManager or Foreground Services\r\n\r\nAs a bonus we’ll also discuss what the future of managing background work and Foreground Services will look like beyond Android 14.",

Is it fast and reliable enough that the team benefits from it?\r\n* Do you need a merge queue or do you need better checks?\r\n* What is consistently missed that you can automate?\r\n* What tedious repetitive tasks can you transform into a welcome resource?\r\n* Are you hitting resource limits that require an engineering investment to mitigate?\r\n* Do you invest in Gradle or Bazel? What JVM options are right for your codebase?\r\n* Is Docker useful? How far should you go in your optimizations?\r\n* How do you secure the pipeline?\r\n \r\nWe'll delve into each topic and share how to apply our learnings to empower you. Along the way we will discuss how to approach stakeholders outside engineering to demonstrate the value it brings to a business.

But going from idea to shipping something on the Play Store isn’t that easy. How do you organize work? What are the roles and tools to use? And most importantly, how to build a framework onto which you can iterate on multiple ideas, fast?\r\n\r\nThat’s what we had to figure out over the past six months as we launched multiple ideas into production. Join us in a retrospective of how we got from that famous beer to today. We’ll cover how an Android dev such as yourself can organize work to prioritize fast iteration, pick the right tools and technologies, automate the heck out of everything, figure out how to promote and grow the app, plan a business strategy, and understand if it is sustainable.\r\n\r\nBy attending this session, you’ll find out what worked out for us and what didn’t in this process, and how to avoid some mistakes we made. If you’ve ever had the itch to publish an app — by yourself or with some friends — come along to find out what’s ahead of you!",

But have you ever thought about how you could seamlessly adapt your existing solutions to play nice with other engines like Unity? Or perhaps you’re considering creating an entirely new library to incorporate functionalities that aren't readily available in the core Unity. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Unity paves the way for hybrid Android development, allowing you to embed Unity-created elements, mini-games and augmented reality directly into your Android apps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we're delving into the Unity landscape from an Android developer's perspective. We'll unravel the intricate interplay between Unity scripts and Android code, gaining insights into how IL2CPP and Mono scripting backends operate to seamlessly unite C# and Kotlin.\r\n",
